                <p>Aryabhata was born on 476 CE in Pataliputra which is present day Patna, Bihar. He is famous for putting out concepts like lunar eclipse and solar eclipse, rotation of Earth on its axis, reflection of light by moon, value of pi correct to 4 decimal places, circumference of Earth to 99.8 per cent accuracy. His works include the famous Aryabhatiya which he wrote when he was just 23 years old. He influenced other future mathematicians and thinkers like Lalla, Bhaskara I, Brahmagupta, Varahamihira.</p>

                <p>Bhaskara was born in the year 1114 in Bijapur in Karnataka. He was an Indian mathematician and astronomer and is known as the greatest mathematician of medieval India. His main work Siddhanta Shiromani (Crown of Treatises) has laid foundations for many theories in arithmetic, algebra, mathematics of the planets, and spheres. He was perhaps the first to conceive the differential coefficient and differential calculus, way before Newton and Leibniz.</p>
